  s.description = <<-DESCRIPTION
Lookback is a tool and library for user experience testing
that you can integrate into your app. Lookback records the
iOS screen, the front-facing camera, microphone, metadata,
touches and active views, and uploads it all in
near-realtime to lookback.io where you can study and dive
into the data. Example use cases:

* User testing sessions. Instead of mounting web cams in your
testing lab to record both the screen and your tester's
reactions, let Lookback do the hard work for you.
* Long-term usability study. Let a user record a week of
using your app, and study trends, reactions and recurring
problems.
* Quality assurance. Record videos of found bugs, complete
with a trace of how the tester reached it.

Use this version of Lookback in versions of your app that you
debug with or submit to testers, but not to Appstore: your app
will be rejected. See the pod LookbackSafe for a version you
can use in the AppStore.
